# fpattern

Like Fallout 2, Arcanum uses `fpattern` to find entries in `.DAT` files. However there is no attribution to the author or the library in the binary, so it's impossible to guess which version it was.

Just in case:

- `0x53E230`: `fpattern_isvalid`
- `0x53E2D0`: `fpattern_match`
- `0x53E320`: `fpattern_submatch`
- `0x53E590`: `fpattern_matchn`
